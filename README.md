### Project Description

This is a simple implementation of the classic *Hangman game*. The game randomly selects a _word_ from a predefined list and the player has to guess the word by suggesting letters. The game keeps track of the _number of lives_ the player has and the number of letters left to guess.

The aim of this project is to practice **object-oriented programming** and **game development** in **Python**. I learned how to create a class to represent the game, handle user input, and implement game logic.

### Installation Instructions

To run the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

**git clone https://github.com/laarnibonifacio/hangman569.git**

Then, navigate to the project directory and run the game using the following command:

**python hangman.py**


### Usage Instructions

1. To play the game, simply run the _â€˜hangman.pyâ€™_ file and follow the prompts. 
2. The game will ask you to guess a letter, and you can enter a single alphabetical character. 
3. If the letter is in the word, the game will prompt if you guess the correct letter. 
4. If the letter is not in the word, the game will reduce the number of lives you have.
5. Most importantly, have fun playing. ðŸ™ƒ

### File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **hangman.py** : 	The main game file that contains the game logic and user interface.
- **hangman_Template.py** : A template file that contains the basic structure of the game.
- **milestone_3.py** : A file that contains the ask_for_input function used in the game.
- **milestone_5.py** : A file that combines milestone_4.py which verifies if the letter is correct and codes the logic of the game.
